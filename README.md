# tree-sitter-masm

This repo contains the source code for the official [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammar for Miden Assembly.

This grammar is used to provide editor/IDE support for Miden Assembly sources, however the canonical parser is still currently implemented in the `miden-assembly` Rust crate, found [here](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm).
